# Bug Fixes

## Double Navbar Issue on ShowBots Page

### Problem

When navigating to http://localhost:5173/showbots, two navbars were appearing during the loading state:

1. The main Navbar rendered by the App component (correct)
2. An additional Navbar rendered within the ShowBots component's loading state (incorrect)

### Solution

Removed the duplicate Navbar from the loading state in the ShowBots component.

### Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/ShowBots.jsx` - Removed Navbar import and usage in loading state

### Verification

After the fix, only one Navbar appears on all pages including ShowBots during loading and after data is loaded.
